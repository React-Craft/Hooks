## 🎯 Custom React-like Hooks Implementation in Vanilla JavaScript
This repository contains a custom implementation of React-like hooks, including useState, useEffect, useRef, useMemo, and useCallback, built entirely using Vanilla JavaScript.

## ⚡Overview
While these implementations mimic the behavior of React’s built-in hooks, they do not function identically to their counterparts in the React package. The goal of this project is to explore and understand the fundamental principles behind React’s state management and lifecycle handling rather than to provide a production-ready alternative.

## 🔍 Key Insights
The implementations exhibit similar behavior to React hooks but do not replicate them exactly due to differences in React's internal reconciliation process.

The true power of React’s hooks lies within the React package itself, which optimizes rendering, manages state efficiently, and provides a declarative UI experience.
